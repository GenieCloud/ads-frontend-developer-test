Test project for Angular.

12/04/2023 - Initial Project Notes

I have run into an issue where the Bootstrap styling is not functioning properly.
Also, when I try to implement the XML parsing to add the data to my table, there is an error showing in the app.component.ts file.
Feedback is much appreciated and I look forward to working on this project further with your team.

12/06/2023 - UI and Angular server setup
I have now fixed my Bootsrap UI issue by breaking the test appilication down into Angular components in order to make debugging as well as new feature implementations easier to configure and test on that locally hosted server using Angular.

I had to make sure that the latest installations of Node.JS npm and the correct versions of Angular are supported given that AngularJS has deprecated to a commonly TypeScript based programming language. This not only makes code easier to solution but also helps the development process more much more efficiently. 

My next goal is to work on the functionality to display a list of contacts from the provided XML file.
